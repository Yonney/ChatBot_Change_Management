Below are the prompts I derived based on the TRICE framework we were taught in class.

T — Task
Create a fully working FAQ chatbot application for Technology Change Management in our IT department. The chatbot must run locally using Node.js, load knowledge from a knowledgebase.pdf file, extract Q/A pairs, perform keyword-based matching, and serve a simple interactive web chat frontend. The output should be a single full application containing both backend and frontend code.

R — Role
Act as a senior full‑stack JavaScript engineer specializing in:

Node.js backend development
PDF text extraction
Lightweight search/matching algorithms
HTML/CSS/JS UI development
Building small self-contained apps without frameworks
Designing clean, readable and well-commented code

You should also understand Technology Change Management concepts such as RFCs, CAB, approvals, lead times, freeze periods, communication plans, and training rollout.

I — Input
Use these inputs to guide development:

The knowledge base will come from a PDF file named knowledgebase.pdf stored in the same project folder.
The PDF may contain structured Q/A or unstructured paragraphs, so the parser must support both.
Chatbot answers must be derived only from the PDF content.
The UI should be a single-page HTML interface served by the Node.js backend.
Questions typed by the user should be matched to relevant answers using fuzzy keyword scoring.


C — Constraints
You must produce code that meets the following rules:
Backend requirements

Use Node.js only, no external frameworks like Express.
Use native http, fs, and path modules.
Use the pdf-extraction npm package to extract text.
Create a function to parse structured Q: / A: pairs.
If no structured pairs exist, fall back to splitting the PDF text into paragraph chunks.
Build fuzzy matching using:

Stopwords filtering
Keyword pattern extraction
Normalization
Basic scoring (ratio of matched keywords)


Return JSON when the UI calls /kb.

Frontend requirements

Must be embedded as a single multi-line HTML string in the backend script.
Must include:

A header
Chat bubbles for user and bot
Typing animation
Africa-inspired dark theme (black/green/red/yellow)
Input box + send button


The browser should handle all chat logic (no server-side answering).

Application structure

Entire app lives in one Node.js file.
Chatbot logic on the client must do all matching locally.
Server should auto-reload KB when the PDF changes.
Code must be clean, modular, and heavily commented.

Behavior

If no match is found (score < 0.35), reply:
“I couldn't confidently match that. Please rephrase.”
Provide match confidence in parentheses.


E — Expectations
Your final answer must:

Return a single JavaScript file containing the entire chatbot system (backend + frontend).
Include comments explaining every significant function and design choice.
Produce code that can run immediately after installing dependencies.
Use strong code organization and readable structure.
Ensure the UI theme and behavior matches an Africa‑themed professional IT chatbot.
Produce results extremely close to production-ready code.


Final prompt used in Microsoft Copilot and Chat GPT.

Create a fully working Node.js-based Technology Change Management FAQ chatbot that loads answers from knowledgebase.pdf,
 extracts structured or unstructured Q/A using pdf-extraction, builds stopword‑filtered keyword patterns,
 performs fuzzy matching to answer user questions, auto-reloads when the PDF changes, 
 and serves a complete Africa‑themed HTML/CSS/JS chat UI from a single file using only the native http, fs, and path modules—producing
 clean, readable, fully commented production-quality code in one file.”
